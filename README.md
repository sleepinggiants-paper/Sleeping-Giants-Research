# Paper Code Repository

This repository contains all the files and resources related to the research on ethical advertising and the Sleeping Giants revisions. Below is an overview of the directory structure and the purpose of each folder and file.

## Directory Structure

### Dynamic Topic Model Plots
This folder contains visualizations of dynamic topic models categorized by different frames:
- `diagnostic_tsot.png`: Diagnostic frame time series of topics.
- `motivational_tsot.png`: Motivational frame time series of topics.
- `non_framing_tsot.png`: Non-framing frame time series of topics.
- `prognostic_tsot.png`: Prognostic frame time series of topics.

### FEVD Plots
This folder includes Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) plots for different windows:
- `Window 1 FEVD.png`
- `Window 4 FEVD.png`
- `Window 7 FEVD.png`
- `Window 10 FEVD.png`

### Impulse Response Plots
This folder contains impulse response plots showing the relationships between different frames and actions:
- `1_responses_of_moti_frame_to_diag_frame.png`: Response of motivational frame to diagnostic frame.
- `10_responses_of_diag_frame_to_acti_mobilization.png`: Response of diagnostic frame to action mobilization.
- `11_responses_of_prog_frame_to_moti_frame.png`: Response of prognostic frame to motivational frame.
- `12_responses_of_prog_frame_to_diag_frame.png`: Response of prognostic frame to diagnostic frame.
- `13_responses_of_prog_frame_to_msnb_breitbart.png`: Response of prognostic frame to media mentions (MSNBC/Breitbart).
- Additional plots follow a similar naming convention.
